    "## Preamble: From Neural Networks to Boltzmann Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It is composed of interconnected nodes, or \"neurons,\" organized in layers. The most basic network consists of an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers**, and an **output layer**. Each connection between neurons has a numerical weight, and each neuron has a bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn by adjusting these weights and biases. Information flows through the network in a process called **forward propagation**, where the input data is multiplied by the weights, summed, and passed through an **activation function** at each neuron. The network's output is then compared to the desired output, and the error is calculated. This error is then propagated backward through the network (**backpropagation**) to update the weights and biases in a way that reduces the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training vs. Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "The process described above is known as **training**. During training, the model learns the patterns and relationships within a dataset. After the model has been trained, it can be used for **inference** or **prediction**. This is the process of using the learned model to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this notebook, our RBM is first trained to learn features from the Iris data in an unsupervised manner (training phase), and then its learned features are used to make predictions with a classifier (inference phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Boltzmann Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Boltzmann Machine** is a special type of neural network that differs from traditional feed-forward networks. It's a **generative, stochastic** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generative** means it can learn to model the underlying distribution of the data, allowing it to generate new data samples similar to the training data.\n",
    "* **Stochastic** means its neurons make decisions randomly, based on probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boltzmann Machines consist of two types of units: **visible units** ($\\mathbf{v}$) and **hidden units** ($\\mathbf{h}$). The visible units represent the observable data, and the hidden units learn to discover abstract features or patterns in that data. The behavior of the network is defined by an **energy function**, which describes the \"goodness\" of a particular configuration of visible and hidden units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy function for a general Boltzmann Machine is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(\\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{h}) = -\\sum_{i<j} w_{ij} s_i s_j - \\sum_i \\theta_i s_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $w_{ij}$ are the weights between units $i$ and $j$, and $\\theta_i$ is the bias for unit $i$. The state of each unit $s_i$ is a binary value (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)** is a simpler version where there are **no connections between units in the same layer** (visible-visible or hidden-hidden). This \"restriction\" simplifies the model and makes its training significantly more efficient."

    "An RBM is a type of generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs. It is composed of two layers: a **visible layer** (for the input data) and a **hidden layer** (for learning features). The \"restricted\" part means there are no connections between units within the same layer. This architecture simplifies the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of an RBM is defined by an **energy function**, which measures how \"bad\" a given configuration of visible and hidden units is.\n",
